# BrainTumorClassifier
### Created a BrainTumorClassifier as a summer internship project along with two of my classmates under the guidance of our learned professor Dr.Manu Vardhan.
## My responsibilty :
### Create a Application for the classifier model to run.
### Created a Frontend template for users to upload the image and  call the predict function of the backend when submit button is clicked.
### Created a FLASK Backend to initialize the model and get the image from post request and converts it  -> img = base64_to_pil(request.json) to make predictions on server side and then the results are jasonified and sent to Frontend TEMPLATE for display.
